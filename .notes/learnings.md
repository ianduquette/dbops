## My learnings on "Vibe" coding wiht Roo:
- Be specific.  Roo will infer stuff and it may not make sense to you.  Especially UI.
    - Initial UI was functional, but the important stuff didn't have enough room.
        - It tried to lay it out proportionally.
        - It likely used the "average consensus of what is in github"
    - I needed to google stuff about Scrollbars on TextView components and "educate" the AI

- Roo will sometimes attempt to compile, and you may have the app running and it will not actually stop the process so it will just hang on the compilation.  Other times it's fine.
